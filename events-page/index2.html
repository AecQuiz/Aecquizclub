                <!-- <h4>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit</h4> -->
                <p>The last but not the least event of the club for the session 2020-21 was Ideathon -2k21 which was basically conducted by the assistant team members of the club. This was an open to all and free of cost competition on a large level consisting of various prize monies and certificates for different positions. This intensive brainstorming event helped the participants to develop and improve their innovations and gave them an opportunity to identify and ideate the most viable solutions to the given problems. People from various institutions from all over the country got themselves registered for this ideathon.</p>
                <!-- <p>An abstract round was conducted at first where the registered teams were asked to submit their abstract for their solutions to the problem themes and 15 teams out of all the registered teams could make it to the finale based on the preliminary judgement scores. In the finale round on 15th of June, the selected teams gave their presentation on google meet platform in front of the jury. The judges were Mr. Amartya Ranjan Saikia and Mr. Subrat Kishore Dutta who are none other than our very own AECians. The winners were declared on the basis of the scored acquired by the teams and prizes and certificates were distributed accordingly. It was undoubtedly one of the most successful events of the session and with this we marked the end of the session 2020-21.</p> -->
